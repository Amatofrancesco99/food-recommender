## Description
A web app, whose purpose is **suggesting recipes to logged users**.

Used recipes **dataset**: [**FoodRecsSysv1**](https://www.kaggle.com/elisaxxygao/foodrecsysv1?select=raw-data_recipe.csv).
<br>
It contains *over 45k recipes*, coming from all over the world!

## Dataset
In order to get the database used for this project (containing *users, recipes & reviews tables*), download this [**.sql.zip file**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jvNXcg9U4UPF0snDHwQG-WGpWct9B1lP/view?usp=sharing).

## Functionalities
The application now returns a *random recipe* taken from the database.<br>
Obviously this is the easiest implementation, but you're free to fork this project and add new functionalities.<br>
Some examples:
- Suggesting a recipe basing on:
  - its nutrients
  - its ingredients
  - ratings given by other users
  - ...
- Handle the possibility to add a personal rating on a recipe, by a logged user.

**Any help will be really appreciated.**
